**MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT)** was established in 2018 as a unit under the Ministry of Health to address some of the longer term issues affecting the lives and health of Singaporeans. The need to consider system-wide transformation of the healthcare system arises in view of the changing needs of Singapore’s diverse and busy families, a fast ageing population and workforce, as well as growing chronic disease burden. MOHT’s strategy for system-wide transformation is aligned with the Ministry of Health’s Beyond Healthcare 2020 Strategy: Beyond Healthcare to Health, Beyond Hospital to Community, and Beyond Quality to Value. These strategies entail a bigger push towards preventive, primary and community care.

MOHT as a small unit collaborates with partners from the health, social and lifestyle sectors in co-developing solutions for our population, with a view to scale the more successful solutions. We work in agile ways to identify areas requiring attention and develop key enablers of ease-of-use and scaling, such as mobile and data technologies, care redesign, and incentive redesign.

As a learning organisation, MOHT seeks to always learn and improve. We will continue to engage and involve our patients, clinical and commercial partners as we conceptualise, build, and validate solutions that are critical for the larger transformation of Singapore’s healthcare system.

For a start, MOHT has identified 3 pillars of healthcare, namely health promotion, primary care and hospital care. Underlying these 3 pillars are horizontal layers based on mobile, data and AI technologies and improved incentive models for both patients and providers. Through these thrusts and strengthening the links between them, MOHT will enable longitudinal, holistic, and cohesive care.
