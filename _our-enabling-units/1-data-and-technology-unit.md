Technology plays a significant role in MOHT’s projects and experiments, and in its operating environment. MOHT adopts an agile approach using rapid and continuous build-measure-learn cycles that identify, develop, deliver and adapt technology to improve health. They work closely with IHiS and implementation partners. This allows MOHT’s teams to be responsive to real needs, as demonstrated by actual data, and nimble in evolving prototypes and scalable solutions.

The main tools being used are:
* Data analytics and modelling to understand healthcare flows and resource usage
* User experience and interface design and development
* Agile development on mobile and cloud
* Artificial Intelligence

Current Initiatives:
* Passive and active sensing tools for patient lifestyle understanding and improvement
* Tele-health monitoring solutions for connected care
* Mobile patient and clinical applications
* Digital phenotyping
* Data analytics, including for patient flow analysis
