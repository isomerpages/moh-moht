### Solutions & Technology Evaluation & Piloting (STEP) Unit
The role of STEP is to support the three programmes, and adopts a two-pronged approach (1) To scan for relevant technology and solutions, and (2) to run pilots to evaluate selected technologies and solutions, with a view to scaling those which are beneficial, cost-effective and can enable care redesign.

The work of the STEP division is guided by MOHT leadership and a Technology Advisory Panel that reviews all recommendations prior to approval and subsequent operationalisation of selected solutions.

In the course of its work, STEP will work closely with partners â€“ clinical and solution providers to design pilots including obtaining the necessary approvals, IRB and institutional clearances.

The goal is to through a robust process of surveillance, selection, pilot implementation and evaluation develop workable solutions that are evidence based and have the potential to be scaled.

Current Initiatives for piloting:
* Health e-coaching (diabetes)
* Home and point-of-care blood testing for diabetes
* Digital phenotyping for mental health
