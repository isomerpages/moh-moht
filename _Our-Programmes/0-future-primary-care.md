Primary care is a critical foundation of our healthcare system in view of Singaporeâ€™s ageing population and the rising prevalence of chronic conditions.

The goal of FPC is to re-position primary care to play a central role in our health delivery system and anchor healthcare in the primary care space. The aspiration is to give patients the care, treatment and resources to manage their conditions confidently at home without the need for a hospital visit. In order to do this, Future Primary Care will work towards improving primary care to provide consistent and accessible quality care for patients.

Future Primary Care is focused on 3 main areas:
* Telehealth initiative: To leverage on new technologies and capabilities that will allow us to shift care into homes and increase the accessibility to and timeliness of care
* Tech-Enhancement of Primary care: Identify, evaluate and implement new technologies that have the potential to improve the delivery of care for patients and stakeholders
* Surveying the primary care landscape: To increase the ability to identify outcomes and gaps in the primary care delivery function using analytics technology

Partners:
* National Healthcare Group Polyclinics

Current Initiatives:
* Tele-health pilot at Ang Mo Kio Polyclinic
