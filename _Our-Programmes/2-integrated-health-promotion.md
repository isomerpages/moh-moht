The goal of Integrated Health Promotion (InHealth) is to implement, within cutting-edge Healthy Precincts, an integrated, whole-of-ecosystem approach to health promotion. This includes facilitating healthy behaviours at the individual and interpersonal levels; encouraging active community participation and leadership in promoting community membersâ€™ health; creating an environment in which it is easy and attractive to be healthy; and fostering policies that support good physical and mental health. The team will work closely with multiple stakeholders including government agencies, community-based organisations, academic institutions, and others. The ultimate aim of InHealth is to shift community attitudes and norms towards health, leading to long-term sustained behaviour change.

The team has begun its work with the development of two Healthy Precincts- the National University of Singapore and Nanyang Technological University, the two largest university campuses in Singapore. NUS and NTU were chosen as the first Path Finder Precincts because they are a confluence of academic expertise, research and technology development, and environments with numerous potential levers (e.g. food vendors, physical infrastructure, educational curriculum) to influence behaviour. They are thus an ideal test-bed for the InHealth solutions, and the development of toolkits with strong academic underpinnings that can subsequently be applied in, or adapted for, other types of precincts nationally e.g. housing precincts.

Partners:
* National University of Singapore (NUS)
* Nanyang Technological University (NTU)

Current Initiatives:
* Creation of solutions that will nudge healthy behaviours
* Development of methodologies and toolkits to enable scaling of efforts
