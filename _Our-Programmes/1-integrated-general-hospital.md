Integrated General Hospital (IGH) is a new hospital care model that integrates acute, sub-acute and rehabilitative care, in ways that address the needs of a growing patient population with multiple medical conditions. IGH focuses on ensuring more holistic care, with a view to improve longer term health outcomes. IGH also integrates community-based resources (e.g. primary care and social services), and engages patients and families, so as to create a health empowering community.

The implementation of IGH is in line with hospitalsâ€™ aspirations to build a health-empowering care model that delivers holistic, team-based care for patients from admission to post-discharge. If IGH is successful, care would be right-sited and coordinated, without unnecessary transfers, with quality doctor-patient interactions that will lead to long-lasting relationships based on trust.

IGH care has three distinctives:
* One ward, one care team
* Seamless care without unnecessary transfers
* Patient-centric care that is integrated with the community

Partners:
* Alexandra Hospital

Current Initiatives:
* Continually enhance an application prototype that streamlines nursing documentation and enables additional analytics at the wards at Alexandra Hospital
* Review and redesign discharge related workflows at Alexandra Hospital
* Co-create future-ready spaces at Alexandra Hospital that could better enable recovery and encourage productive conversations
* Enable a community-based activation movement around Queenstown, involving patient and families as co-creators of care</li>
